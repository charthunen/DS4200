        <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
        <p><strong>Topic:</strong> <span>This investigation looks into the relationship between weather conditions, Tesla stock market behaviour as well as gas and oil prices.
            The aim was to explore weather there was a correlation between Tesla stocks and environmental factors, such as temperature and precipitation, and consequently oil and gas prices.
        Our reason for pursuing this project is the conversations around sustainability within the electric car market. 
        To ensure we were within the scope of this project we specified that the weather data should be from Austin, Texas, as that is where Tesla's headquarters were for the majority of the time from when the data was taken. 
    Tesla is a key player within technical, financial and environmental spheres. 
By seeing how environmental and energy-related variables influence the stock price could provide insights for investors and analysts.</span></p>
        <p><strong>Tasks:</strong> <span> We firstly collected the Tesla stock prices and Austin weather data, however after our first iteration it was discovered that there was no immediate correlation, therefore we included the oil and gas prices as additional features. 
            We then created interactive visualisations which allowed for a greater analysis of the data as well as statistical analysis in order to extract more insight from the data.

        <h2>Visualizations</h2>

            <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> This line graph shows Tesla stock closing prices against the daily temperature in Austin, Texas from 2014 to 2024.
                The stock prices shows a clear positive correlation indicating a growing trend. Temperature, on the other hand, demonstrates a consistent seasonal cycle. 
                There is no obvious correlation between the daily temperature fluctuations and Tesla stock prices, suggesting that weather does not have a direct or consistent impact on stock performance, nor has Tesla rise in popularity brought down temperatures, specifically in Austin.
            The interactivity within the graph allows the user to explore specific dates and therefore can show the corresponding stock price and temperature. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="visualization">
            <iframe src="visuals/correlation_heatmap.html" width="700" height="550" style="border:none;"></iframe>
            <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> This heatmap shows the correlation between all variables across the combined dataset, which includes weather attributes, Tesla stock features and the gas prices. 
            Tesla's stock metrics are very strongly correlated with each other. In addition, the weather variables also had high correlations. 
        Gas prices, however, showed a mild correlation with Tesla stock prices, indicating that there may be a relationship, however it is not strong. 
    There are negative correlations with features such as precipitation and stock volume and price, however they are weak and therefore would need more investigation.  </p>

        <div class="visualization">
            <iframe src="visuals/scatter_plot_temp_vs_tesla.html" width="850" height="400" style="border:none;"></iframe>
            <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> This scatter plot shows the relationship between daily temperature and Tesla stock price with the bubble size indicating the trading volume. 
            The graph shows are very weak relationship between temperature and Tesla stock price as there is no clear linear pattern. 
        The larger bubbles are sporadic and do not have a strong concentration and a particular temperature range, however there are some high volume days at cooler temperatures, however there is nothing to indicate that this is related to weather factors.</p>

        <div class="visualization">
            <iframe src="visuals/dashboard.html" width="770" height="700" style="border:none;"></iframe>
            <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> The top line graphs shows Tesla's stock price over the past 10 years. The stock price remained flat until late 2019 with a rise in 2020-2021 and has increased since. 
            The bottom scatter plot shows Tesla's stock against temperature including colour encoding for different temperature levels. 
        The graphs show the shifts within Tesla's value over time, however it could be said that this is more relevant to market and company shifts, rather than environmental factors, nor does it demonstrate that an increase of purchases of Tesla stock has improved the environment. 
    There is slight clustering of higher prices around moderate to warmer temperatures which could demonstrate seasonality effects. </p>

        <div class="visualization">
            <iframe src="visuals/distribution_tesla_stock_price.html" width="850" height="500" style="border:none;"></iframe>
            <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> This bar chart shows the average Tesla stock price for each 10F temperature bin, with the error bars with represent the standard deviation. 
            This chart shows that Tesla's stock price does not show a consistent upward nor downward trend across temperature bins. 
        Temperature ranges show relatively similar average prices demonstrating that temperature has no strong predictive power over the Tesla stock price. 
    The error bars are large which suggests a wide price fluctuation.  </p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p><strong>Main Takeaways:</strong> In conclusion, our analysis found no strong linear realtionship between Tesla's stock price and 
        weather variables like temperature, precipitation or wind speed. 
    The visualisations showed that stock performance was in fact more heavily influenced by time and wider market changes than environmental factors. 
In addition, the increase in Tesla stock sales has not improved nor impacted the environment. 
However, it could be said that there is a mild correlation between rising gas prices and increases in Tesla stock, therefore indicating that there could be an investor sentiment towards electric vehicles when traditional fuel costs rise.  </p>
        <p><strong>Future Steps:</strong> In order to further this investigation the dataset could be expanded in order to include additional cities or national wide weather data. 
        It could include more companies in the electric vehicle market for comparison. 
    We could also apply machine learning models such as random forest in order to test for non-linear patterns.  </p>
